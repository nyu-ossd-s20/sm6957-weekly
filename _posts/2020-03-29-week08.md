Project Development: 

This week has been extremely successful as my team and I continue to push forward with developing our project. We have created a user story and product requirement document that details all the necessary features that we will be adding to our portion of Oppia’s website. Although I previously did not have experience in product development, my teammates did. I was able to learn from their previous experiences on what it takes to build a product while keeping the user at the forefront of our decision making process. 

Given that Oppia is used internationally, we had the opportunity to have a Zoom meeting with an Oppia instructor in Palestine. This was an insightful meeting where the instructor detailed her experiences using Oppia, what she wished was on the site when she got started, and how her students engage with Oppia’s materials. It was also brought to my team’s attention that some of the students that the instructor is working with weren’t digitally literate (i.e., they were not familiar with how to use a keyboard, how to get to the browser and use it properly, how to “Google search” information, etc…) Keeping this in mind, we had to adjust our product requirement document to include basic information on how teachers and parents can help their students navigate the internet.

PRESENTATIONS:

Vicky’s presentation offered some insight on her work and also general information about open source communities. I appreciated that she told us about things such as HacktoberFest which before she mentioned it, I have never heard of.  Additionally, prior to her coming into this class, I did not know that Vicky was an available resource at the university to contact/ask about open source, using GitHub, etc. Although I only have a few months left at NYU, I would love the opportunity to keep in touch with Vicky as she offered an interesting perspective to tech as someone who uses computer science in a non-traditional way.
